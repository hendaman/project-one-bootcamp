Exploring Mobility Patterns in Metropolitan Melbourne (June 2018-June 2022)

*Please note, original project located at https://github.com/hendaman/project-1-challenge

Repo had issues with LFS restrictions not allowing pushing and pulling so new repo was created for submission of final product.

Datasets from the original project location will need to be used, but they were not able to be pushed due to being large in size. These have also been provided via ZIP in Slack to a TA.

Project Description

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted transportation and mobility patterns in many cities, including Melbourne. This study aims to investigate how mobility patterns in Metropolitan Melbourne have evolved from June 2018 to June 2022, with a focus on the impact of the pandemic. We will analyze the data to answer several research questions related to public transport usage, pedestrian traffic, and the effects of the pandemic on mobility.

Research Questions

Which stations saw the greatest change in public transport usage/pedestrian traffic? Which municipality saw the greatest change in public transport usage? And which station saw the greatest change in the City of Melbourne?

How has each of the different modes of public transport increased or decreased in usage over the pandemic?

How has the volume of pedestrian traffic in Melbourneâ€™s CBD evolved over the time frame? (Explore peak and off-peak hours)

Did the pandemic affect people traveling during peak hours by public transport in Melbourne?

Datasets
We will be using the following datasets for our analysis:

Monthly public patronage by mode (XLS/CSV): https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/monthly-public-transport-patronage-by-mode

Annual regional train station patronage (station entries) (XLS/CSV): https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/annual-regional-train-patronage-station-entries

Pedestrian Counting System - Monthly (counts per hour) (CSV): https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-monthly-counts-per-hour/information/

Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations (API): https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-sensor-locations/information/

Pedestrian Counting System - Past Hour (counts per minute) (API): https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-past-hour-counts-per-minute/information/
